Simple blog for practice with mongoose and node express


Coding along became quite frustrating.

first, be sure to be aware of package versions. Either use the package.json (and packages) provided by the lesson, or if you are using current versions, make sure to modify lesson code to match current package syntax and functionality.

secondly, the lesson videos skip around a bit, missing some necessary coding steps. debugging these on your own will take some time.

I stopped at second to last video (at Editing Posts).
